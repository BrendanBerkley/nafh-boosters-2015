# NAFH Boosters Theme

## Stylesheet setup

- `gem install sass`
- `sass -v` to make sure it works
- get into nafh-boosters-2015 theme
- `sass --watch sass:css`

## Random notes

Created events categories nested: Spring 2015, then all the stuff in Spring 2015.

Events manager - stuff that needs to be changed in admin:

- Pages > Event Pages > Display events as: Pages
- Pages > Location Pages > Display locations as: Pages
- look up plugins/events-manager/things to override in admin.html
